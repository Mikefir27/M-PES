M-PES:
GUI to plot Potential Energy Surfaces.
1) Load .csv file to load the energy profiles.
2) Set the refference energy profile:
The first energy of this profile will be used as Energy = 0. The energy from the rest of profiles will use this refference.
Then click Normalize.
3) Open Settings to configure the visual aspects of the PES.
4) eV to kcal to change the energy from eV to kcal/mol.
5) Open second csv to open another PES and plot it along the first one. This is used to compare different PES.
6) Plot: Plot the PES.

.csv file format:
First row: Enter the desired name of the mechanism.
Third row: Enter the name of the structures contained in the energy profile.
Fifth row: Enter the quantity of energy profiles plotted.
Next rows: Enter the name of the energy profile and the energy of every PES structure.
